# Mezo Integration Strategy

Strategic plan for integrating MUSD (Mezo Bitcoin-backed stablecoin) into BountyPay.

---

## Executive Summary

BountyPay enables automated bounty payouts for open-source contributions. Currently supporting USDC on Base, integrating MUSD unlocks a Bitcoin-native funding model where sponsors can fund bounties with Bitcoin-backed stablecoins while maintaining BTC exposure.

**Value Proposition:**

- Bitcoin holders can sponsor bounties without selling BTC
- Contributors receive stable payments backed by Bitcoin collateral
- Expands funding sources beyond traditional stablecoin holders
- Aligns with Mezo's self-service banking model

---

## Why MUSD for BountyPay?

### Problem: Limited Funding Sources

- Current system only accepts USDC
- Bitcoin holders must sell BTC or convert to stablecoins to participate
- Lost opportunity cost for sponsors who believe in BTC long-term

### Solution: Bitcoin-Backed Bounty Funding

MUSD enables sponsors to:

1. Mint MUSD against Bitcoin collateral (1% fixed rate)
2. Fund bounties while maintaining BTC exposure
3. Close positions when bounty resolves or refunds
4. Maintain full control over collateral ratios

### Strategic Fit

- **Daily Bitcoin Applications** - Makes bounty funding accessible to Bitcoin holders
- **Financial Access** - Productive use of Bitcoin capital without requiring sales
- **DeFi Integration** - Connects GitHub workflows to Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem

## Integration Architecture

### Multi-Token Support

```plaintext
Current:
┌──────────────┐
│ USDC on Base │──→ BountyEscrow ──→ Contributors
└──────────────┘

Enhanced:
┌──────────────┐
│ USDC on Base │──┐
└──────────────┘  │
                  ├──→ BountyEscrow ──→ Contributors
┌──────────────┐  │
│ MUSD on Mezo │──┘
└──────────────┘
```

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Contract Architecture

```solidity
// Enhanced BountyEscrow with multi-token support
struct Bounty {
    bytes32 repoIdHash;
    address sponsor;
    address resolver;
    address token;           // NEW: Token address (USDC or MUSD)
    uint96 amount;
    uint64 deadline;
    uint64 issueNumber;
    Status status;
}

function createBounty(
    address resolver,
    bytes32 repoIdHash,
    uint64 issueNumber,
    uint64 deadline,
    uint256 amount,
    address token          // NEW: Token selection
) external returns (bytes32 bountyId)
```

#### 2. Supported Tokens Registry

```solidity
// Whitelist approach for security
mapping(address => TokenConfig) public supportedTokens;

struct TokenConfig {
    bool enabled;
    uint8 decimals;
    uint256 minBounty;     // Minimum bounty amount
    string symbol;
}

// Admin functions
function addToken(address token, TokenConfig config) external onlyOwner
function removeToken(address token) external onlyOwner
```

#### 3. Mezo Network Integration

- Deploy contracts on Mezo testnet
- Bridge MUSD to Base (if cross-chain support needed)
- Support native MUSD on Mezo network

   ↓
9. Sponsor's MUSD position unlocked
   ↓
10. Sponsor can close Mezo position or maintain it
```

### Contributor Flow: Receiving MUSD

```plaintext
1. Contributor completes bounty
   ↓

## Business Model Enhancement

### Current Model

- Sponsors deposit USDC
- 2-5% protocol fee on successful resolutions
- Fees collected in USDC

### Enhanced Model with MUSD

- Accept both USDC and MUSD
- Protocol fees configurable per token
- Fee vault accepts multi-token deposits
- Potential yield strategies:
  - Deposit MUSD in Mezo liquidity pools
  - Earn yield on collected protocol fees
  - Cover operational costs with DeFi yields

## Technical Considerations

### Network Strategy

**Option A: Mezo Native**

- Deploy on Mezo network
- Use MUSD natively
- Simplest integration
- Best alignment with Mezo ecosystem

**Option B: Multi-Chain**

- Support both Base (USDC) and Mezo (MUSD)
- Cross-chain bridging for contributors
- More complex but broader reach

**Recommendation:** Start with Option A for hackathon, expand to Option B post-launch

### Security Considerations

1. **Token Whitelist**
   - Only support vetted, audited tokens
   - Admin-controlled token additions
   - Emergency pause per token

2. **Oracle Integration** (Future)
   - Price feeds for token conversions
   - Fair value displays in UI
   - Risk management for volatile tokens

3. **Collateral Monitoring** (Optional)
   - Track Mezo position health for sponsors
   - Warn if collateral ratio drops
   - Prevent liquidation-related refund issues

### Gas Optimization

```solidity
// Efficient multi-token storage
struct Bounty {
    // Pack into single slot where possible
    address token;           // 20 bytes
    uint96 amount;          // 12 bytes (96 bits)
    // Next slot
    address sponsor;        // 20 bytes
    uint64 deadline;        // 8 bytes
    uint64 issueNumber;     // 8 bytes
    Status status;          // 1 byte
}
```
