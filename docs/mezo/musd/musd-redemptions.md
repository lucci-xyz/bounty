# How to Redeem MUSD on Mezo




# Quick Overview


Redeeming lets you burn 1 MUSD to recieve $1 in BTC (minus a 0.75% redemption fee and gas fees). The system redeems starting from the trove with the lowest collateral ratio above 110%. If the amount of MUSD exceeds a single trove, it will continue to redeem in ascending order of collateraliztion ratio.


Troves with collateralization ratios below 110% are eligible for liquidation, and cannot be redeemed against.





# Prerequisites


Before you start, verify:



- System is accepting redemptions: Go to TroveManager → “Read as Proxy” → call getTCR() with current BTC price. Must show ≥ 1100000000000000000 (110%)

- You have MUSD: Check your balance on the MUSD token contract

- Get current BTC price: Go to PriceFeed → “Read as Proxy” → call fetchPrice()

- Get correct contract addresses: See contract addresses at the bottom for both Mainnet and Testnet.





# Step-by-Step Instructions




# 1. Go to TroveManager Contract


Open the TroveManager contract in your block explorer and click the “Write as Proxy” tab.




# 2. Find Function 11: redeemCollateral


You’ll see 6 input fields. Here’s how to fill them:





# Option A: Quick &amp; Simple (Higher Gas)


Use this if you want to redeem quickly without calculating hints.



- _amount: [your amount in wei - see conversion below]

- _firstRedemptionHint: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

- _upperPartialRedemptionHint: [your wallet address]

- _lowerPartialRedemptionHint: [your wallet address]

- _partialRedemptionHintNICR: 1100000000000000000000

- _maxIterations: 0


Converting MUSD to Wei:



- 100 MUSD = 100000000000000000000

- 5,005 MUSD = 5005000000000000000000


Formula: Your amount × 1000000000000000000





# Option B: With Hints (Lower Gas)


Use this to save on gas costs.




# Step 1: Get Redemption Hints


Go to HintHelpers → “Read as Proxy” → getRedemptionHints()


Fill in:



- _amount: Your amount in wei (same as above)

- _price: Current BTC price from PriceFeed

- _maxIterations: 50


Copy the returned values:



- firstRedemptionHint

- partialRedemptionHintNICR




# Step 2: Get Position Hints


Go to SortedTroves → “Read as Proxy” → findInsertPosition()


Fill in:



- _NICR: Use the partialRedemptionHintNICR from Step 1

- _prevId: Your wallet address

- _nextId: Your wallet address


Copy the returned values:



- upperHint

- lowerHint




# Step 3: Call redeemCollateral


Go back to TroveManager → “Write as Proxy” → redeemCollateral



- _amount: [your amount in wei]

- _firstRedemptionHint: [from Step 1]

- _upperPartialRedemptionHint: [upperHint from Step 2]

- _lowerPartialRedemptionHint: [lowerHint from Step 2]

- _partialRedemptionHintNICR: [from Step 1]

- _maxIterations: 50





# What You’ll Receive


Example: Redeeming 100 MUSD



- You burn: 100 MUSD

- You receive: $99.25 worth of BTC (0.75% fee goes to protocol)


Formula: (Your MUSD Amount ÷ BTC Price) × 0.9925 = BTC received





# Common Issues


“Cannot redeem when TCR &lt; MCR”
→ System TCR is below 110%. Wait until it recovers.


“Unable to redeem any amount”
→ This can happen for several reasons:



- No troves available with collateral ratio above 110%

- Hints are out of date (specifically the NICR hint)

- The redemption amount would leave the target trove with less than the minimum debt requirement of 1,800 MUSD

- Max iterations set too low for the redemption size


Transaction runs out of gas
→ Lower _maxIterations to 10 or split into smaller redemptions.


Transaction reverts unexpectedly
→ Get fresh hints and try again. Someone may have redeemed before you.


Received less than expected
→ Check the Redemption event in your transaction. Some MUSD may have been returned if the last trove would go below 1,800 MUSD minimum.





# Tips



- Generate hints immediately before redeeming - They become stale if someone else redeems first

- Use Option A for small amounts (&lt; $10,000) - The higher gas cost is negligible

- Use Option B for large amounts - Saves significant gas on big redemptions

- Set higher maxIterations for larger redemptions:

Small (&lt; 10 troves): 10

- Medium (10-30 troves): 50

- Large (30+ troves): 100
