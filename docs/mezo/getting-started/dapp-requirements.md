Although the network is permissionless and anybody can deploy to Mezo Mainnet, dApps on Mezo must meet the following requirements to be featured in the Mezo Market and receive promotional support:



- Mezo Passport: Developers must use Mezo Passport in their dApps to provide additional wallet connection options tailored to Bitcoin wallets and Mezo Mainnet. Passport is a React library that works with RainbowKit and does not require a specific development environment.

- MUSD Integration: dApps must integrate MUSD, the native collateralized stablecoin of the Mezo ecosystem. Integration can include supporting MUSD for payments, as a primary liquidity asset, or within other core functions of the dApp.

- Audit Report: The dApp must have completed a third-party security audit. The report must be submitted to the Mezo team via the intake form.

- Mainnet Functionality: The dApp must be fully deployed and functional on Mezo Mainnet.
