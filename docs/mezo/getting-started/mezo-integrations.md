# Pyth


The Pyth Network is one of the largest first-party Oracle networks and delivers real-time data across several chains including Mezo. Pyth introduces an innovative low-latency pull oracle design where users can pull price updates onchain when needed. This enables everyone in the onchain environment to access data points efficiently. The Pyth network updates the prices every 400ms to make Pyth one of the fastest onchain oracles.
