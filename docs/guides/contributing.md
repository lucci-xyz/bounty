## High-Impact Ideas

Looking for something impactful to work on? Here are some areas we'd love help with:

**Ideas Welcomed:**
- Reputation systems
- Deposit requirements
- Social recovery mechanisms

- Time-locked reveals

### 2. Mezo Passport Integration

- OKX Wallet

**Requirements:**
- Bitcoin signature verification

**Features:**
- Token swaps on deposit
- Cross-chain bounties
- Automatic token conversion
- Unified liquidity management

### 4. Proof-of-Work Collectibles

**Goal:** Mint contribution NFTs as on-chain receipts for completed bounties.

**Features:**
- NFT minted when bounty resolves
- Contains bounty metadata (repo, issue, amount)
- Transferable proof of contribution
- Optional: Rarity based on bounty size

### 5. Security & Audits

**Critical Area:** Help us continuously audit contracts, bot logic, and wallet flows.

**Areas to Review:**
