## What BountyPay does

BountyPay is a GitHub App that helps repository maintainers fund issues and pay contributors when work is accepted.

## Data we collect

### From GitHub (via the GitHub App / OAuth)

Depending on the permissions you grant and how you use BountyPay, we may receive:

* **Account and organization info:** GitHub username, user ID, org/repo membership (as needed for authorization)
* **Repository data:** repo name/ID, installation ID, permissions, webhook events
* **Issue/PR metadata:** issue/PR numbers, titles, labels, comments, merge status, commit SHAs (metadata only)
* **User-generated content in GitHub:** content you submit to BountyPay through GitHub (e.g., commands/comments used to fund or manage bounties)

### From you (when using the BountyPay web app)

* **Email address** (if you provide it for access, notifications, or support)
* **Wallet address** (for payout routing and attribution)
* **App activity metadata:** timestamps, actions taken, basic logs for debugging and security

### On-chain data

BountyPay may reference blockchain transaction data (e.g., escrow funding/payout transactions). **Blockchain data is public by nature** and not controlled by BountyPay.

## How we use data

We use data to:

* Provide core functionality (create/manage bounties, verify merges, trigger payouts)
* Authenticate and authorize users
* Prevent abuse and secure the service
* Provide support and troubleshoot issues
* Communicate service-related notices (optional/if enabled)

We do **not** sell personal data. We do **not** use GitHub data for third-party advertising.

## Legal bases (if applicable)

Where required (e.g., GDPR), we process data based on:

* **Contract/legitimate interests** to provide and secure the service
* **Consent** where you explicitly opt into notifications or marketing (if ever offered)

## Sharing and disclosure

We share data only as needed to operate the service:

* **Service providers** (hosting, databases, monitoring/logging) acting as processors
* **GitHub** (through normal App/API/webhook interactions)
* **Compliance** if required by law, subpoena, or to protect rights/safety
* **Business transfer** if we undergo a merger/acquisition (with notice where required)

## Data retention

We retain data only as long as necessary:

* **Core operational records** (bounty state, installation IDs, payout references) while you use the service
* After uninstall/termination, we delete or anonymize data within **90 days**, except where we must keep records for legal, security, or dispute reasons.

## Security

We use reasonable safeguards such as access controls, encryption in transit, and logging/monitoring. No method of transmission/storage is 100% secure.

## Your choices and rights

You can:

* Uninstall the GitHub App to stop new data flow from GitHub
* Request access, correction, or deletion of personal data (where applicable) by emailing **[contact@luccilabs.xyz](mailto:contact@luccilabs.xyz)**
* If you’re in California: you may have rights under CCPA/CPRA, including “Do Not Sell/Share” (we do not sell/share for cross-context behavioral advertising).

## International transfers

If we transfer data across borders, we use appropriate safeguards where required.

## Children

BountyPay is not intended for children under 13 (or the age required by local law).

## Changes to this policy

We may update this policy. We will revise the effective date and, if changes are material, provide reasonable notice.
