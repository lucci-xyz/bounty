## Smart Contracts

BountyPay supports multiple networks. You can choose your preferred network when creating a bounty.

### Base Sepolia Testnet

**Network Details:**
- Chain ID: `84532`
- Native Currency: ETH
- RPC URL: `https://sepolia.base.org`

| FeeVault | [`0xA6fe4832D8eBdB3AAfca86438a813BBB0Bd4c6A3`](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xA6fe4832D8eBdB3AAfca86438a813BBB0Bd4c6A3) | Protocol fee collection vault |
| USDC (Test) | [`0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e`](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e) | Test USDC token (6 decimals) |

### Mezo Testnet

**Network Details:**
- Chain ID: `31611`
- Native Currency: BTC (Bitcoin)
- RPC URL: `https://rpc-http.mezo.boar.network` (Boar Network - reliable alternative)
- Block Explorer: [`https://explorer.test.mezo.org`](https://explorer.test.mezo.org)

> **Note:** The default RPC uses Boar Network for better reliability. You can customize this by setting `VITE_MEZO_RPC_URL` in your environment variables.

**Deployed Contracts:**

| Contract | Address | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| BountyEscrow | [`0xA6fe4832D8eBdB3AAfca86438a813BBB0Bd4c6A3`](https://explorer.test.mezo.org/address/0xA6fe4832D8eBdB3AAfca86438a813BBB0Bd4c6A3) | Main escrow contract for bounty funds |
| FeeVault | [`0xa8Fc9DC3383E9E64FF9F7552a5A6B25885e5b094`](https://explorer.test.mezo.org/address/0xa8Fc9DC3383E9E64FF9F7552a5A6B25885e5b094) | Protocol fee collection vault |
| MUSD (Test) | [`0x118917a40FAF1CD7a13dB0Ef56C86De7973Ac503`](https://explorer.test.mezo.org/address/0x118917a40FAF1CD7a13dB0Ef56C86De7973Ac503) | Mezo USD stablecoin (18 decimals) |

> **Note:** Each network operates independently. Bounties created on Base Sepolia use USDC, while bounties on Mezo Testnet use MUSD. There is no bridging between networks.

Audit reports and deployment history are coming soon.

## Quick Troubleshooting

### Wallet Connection Issues

- **Wallet not connecting**: Ensure you're on the correct network:
  - Base Sepolia (Chain ID: 84532) for USDC bounties
  - Mezo Testnet (Chain ID: 31611) for MUSD bounties
- **Transaction fails**: Check you have enough native currency for gas fees:
  - Base Sepolia requires ETH
  - Mezo Testnet requires BTC
- **Token approval fails**: Verify you have sufficient token balance (USDC on Base or MUSD on Mezo)

### Payment Not Received

- **PR merged but no payment**: Verify you've linked your GitHub account to your wallet
- **Check wallet link**: Visit `/link-wallet` and ensure your GitHub account is connected
- **Verify PR closes issue**: The PR must close the issue (not just reference it)

### GitHub App Issues

- **Bot not responding**: Check the GitHub App is installed and has correct permissions
- **No "Create bounty" button**: Ensure the bot has write access to issues
- **Webhook errors**: Verify webhook URL is correctly configured in GitHub App settings

For more detailed troubleshooting, see the [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting.md).
