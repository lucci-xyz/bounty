## Quick Troubleshooting

### Wallet Connection Issues
- **Wallet not connecting**: Ensure you're on Base Sepolia network (Chain ID 84532)
- **Transaction fails**: Check you have enough Base ETH for gas fees
- **USDC approval fails**: Verify you have sufficient USDC balance

### Payment Not Received
- **PR merged but no payment**: Verify you've linked your GitHub account to your wallet
- **Check wallet link**: Visit `/link-wallet` and ensure your GitHub account is connected
- **Verify PR closes issue**: The PR must close the issue (not just reference it)

### GitHub App Issues
- **Bot not responding**: Check the GitHub App is installed and has correct permissions
- **No "Create bounty" button**: Ensure the bot has write access to issues
- **Webhook errors**: Verify webhook URL is correctly configured in GitHub App settings

For more detailed troubleshooting, see the [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting.md).
