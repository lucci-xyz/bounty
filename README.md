_Automated, trust-minimised bounty payouts for open-source contributions. Fund with USDC on Base or MUSD on Mezo and let BountyPay handle the rest._

## Get Started in Minutes

1. **Install the GitHub App**

2. **Open a New Issue** and click the `Create a bounty` button from the BountyPay bot.

3. **Choose Your Network & Fund**

- **Base Sepolia**: Fund with USDC (EVM standard)
- **Mezo Testnet**: Fund with MUSD (Bitcoin L2)

Funds sit safely in escrow.

4. **Merge the winning PR** — BountyPay automatically pays the contributor once the PR closes the issue.

That's it. No invoices, no manual transfers, no spreadsheets.
