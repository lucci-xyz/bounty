# Code Review — Gatekeeper

## Context

- path: `{{file_path}}`
- repo: `{{repo_tree}}`
- manifests/tests: `{{package_files}}` • `{{tests}}`

### diff

```diff
{{diff}}
```

### selection

```text
{{selection}}
```

## Gate

Output exactly: `Risk: <Low|Med|High>. Ship: <Yes|No>.`

- If **No**, list only blockers.

## Findings

For each issue:

- `**[Severity|Confidence]** Title — evidence (file:line or short snippet)`
- Minimal patch:

```diff
# patch
```

Severity: Blocker/High/Med/Low/Nit. Confidence: High/Med/Low.
No code restatement. Smallest safe change. No speculation.

## Checklist (order)

1. Correctness
2. Security
3. Reliability
4. Performance
5. Contracts/APIs & migrations
6. Tests
7. Observability
8. Maintainability

## Tests

- Bullet concrete cases (Given/When/Then names only).

## Observability

- Logs/metrics/traces at boundaries (where; fields).

## Heuristics (use if relevant)

- TS/JS: narrow types; validate inputs; avoid loop awaits; SSR/client guards.
- Python: set timeouts; no bare `except`; validate inputs.
- Go: check errors; propagate `context`.
- Rust: no `unwrap` in prod paths.
- Solidity: CEI; reentrancy guard; access control.
- DB: parameterized queries; indexes for new access patterns; backward-compatible migrations.
